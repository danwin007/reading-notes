## Discussion Questions:

1. What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?
- It allows you to change types on the fly as needed, creating flexibility in your code.
2. What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?
- That flexibility can create weird errors when your variable becomes the wrong type.
3. Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?
- It depends on the method of programming? I think in functional programming, you do not want the parameters to change when the function returns. But in object-oriented programming, that might be okay?
4. Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?
- I am not sure about this one. Are we talking about objects? Which have prototypes built into them? And which can inherit prototypes from higher level objects?
