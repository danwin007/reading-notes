1. What does a componentâ€™s lifecycle refer to?
- It refers to methods such as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. These functions are automatically called when a class component renders, mounts, changes, unmounts, etc.
2. Why are functional components preferred over class components?
- They are shorter and simpler which saves on code length and code complexity.
3. What is wrong with the following code?
- There is no return effect defined within `useEffect`.
