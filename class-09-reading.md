1. Describe a use-case where param middleware would come in handy.
- It can be useful for validating or formatting the req.params key-value before that value is consumed by a CRUD operation.
2. What are the two ways to add middleware in-between Mongoose and MongoDB interactions?
- Pre and Post Hook.
3. What is the difference between a join by reference and a virtual join?
- A reference tells a param to look into a different schema for its value. I can't really tell what a virtual join does. 
4. What do localField and foreignField mean?
- localField is the source and it gets its value by copying from the target, foreignField? I do not know if that is correct.
