1. What is the difference between the variables `MyContext` and `MyProvider` in the examples above?
* MyContext is what does the work of sharing the state variables. MyProvider holds the state variables. 
2. Why is context useful?
* It allows you to pass a state down the component tree through a provider-consumer relationship.
3. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
* I think so? If you pass it using myContext?
