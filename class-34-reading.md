## React Native
* Native dev is developing something specifically for a platform?
* Native apps were built for their platforms. Responsive apps have to serve many different platforms.
* Seems like you can code everything in JavaScript!

## Expo
* Expo is the environment for building. It gives you access to the phone's functions like camera, location, notifications, haptics, sensors, and all that with universal APIs.
* You can even run a sandbox environment in the browser.
