1. What is a data structure?
- A data structure is a way of organizing data such that it can be used efficiently.
2. How is a Linked List different from an array?
- Linked lists are different in that they also handle a reference to the next node in the list.
3. What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?
- It is easier to add/remove data in linked lists compared to arrays.
4. What data does a Node hold in a doubly Linked List?
- It holds the same data it would hold in any other list. However, it can move to both the previous and the next node. Whereas nodes in a singly linked list can only move to the next node.
5. What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)
- After some googling it looks like linked lists are implemented via classes!
