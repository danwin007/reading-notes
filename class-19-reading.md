1. What is the main benefit of a message queue server?
- It allows us to centralize logic which makes client more lightweight. Also makes sure that all connected clients get up to date data. Attached clients can pulldown items they may have missed while disconnected. 
2. Why might we want to initiate messages from an HTTP request?
- I believe because HTTP allows us more security, and a constant connection? 
3. Is the Message Queue Server a socket.io client, a socket.io server, or an api server?
- Socket.io server.
