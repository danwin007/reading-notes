1. Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.
- Access control ensures that only authorized users are able to get to certain parts of the system. A CMS needs access control to limit who can do what. This ensures that some users can review material where others can edit material.
2. What is a role used for?
- A role is like a tier of access. This separates who can get to what.
3. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- Role based access control makes user management easier. You can just plop users in to predefined roles with predefined access scopes. Doing the same thing with discretionary or mandatory access control would require configuring a long list of access points over and over for each new user.
