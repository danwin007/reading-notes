1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
- Running JavaScript outside of a browser allows us to do more than build simple websites. To do this, we will need to use a new ecosystem or environment.
2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
- Modules are pieces of JavaScript code that are meant to be called in another codebase. Modules mostly act as complex functions. Packages are a level higher than modules: they are complex chunks of code that do much more complex things. Think of them as a bundle of related modules???
3. What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?
- Using TDD can help prevent uncertainty during the development process.
4. What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?
- A downside of TDD is, I assume, how much more time it may take to develop something? I also assume that having to create tests along the way introduces additional space for errors to occur and multiply.
5. What does the node package manager do?
- NPM is like a platform for creating, sharing, and using pieces of code, or entire programs, made by other independent developers.
