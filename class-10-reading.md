1. Why is authentication important?
- Authentication ensures that only the appropriate user or system has access to a resource.
2. Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?
- If you store a password incorrectly, it can be intercepted by bad actors and used against you or your users.
3. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
- Hashing is a one-way function that scrambles some text into a unique string. There should be no way to reverse the hashed string to reveal the original info. Encryption is a two-way function. The encrypted information can be decrypted into its original form if you have the proper key.
4. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
- Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same system that encoded the original data. Encryption is used to ensure data confidentiality and requires the use of a key to decrypt the data into the original form.
5. What is a token used for?
- Tokens are used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof info about a user.
