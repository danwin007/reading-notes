3. Fundamentally, what does it mean to have a mock of something? Why is this useful?
- A mock of something is a duplicate that is structurally the same. This allows us to test processes and operations on the mock object without having to possibly break or alter our real object. The mock also only exists for the lifetime of the test.
4. What does it mean to have a mock database?
- A mock database is instantiated in order to test processes and functions. It is created and initialized when tests are started. It is deleted when tests are complete.
