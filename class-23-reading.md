1. Why might you want to create a FormInput component?
- This allows you to modularize a larger parent Form component with different input fields that behave in different ways.
2. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
- It doesn't look like parents can do this?
3. What can be passed along in a prop variable?
- Data and/or entire functions!
